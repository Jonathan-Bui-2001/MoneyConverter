Hello, welcome to MoneyConverter.

This application is for currency conversion in real-time.
I made it with Kotlin and tested it on AVM Pixel 7XL - API 33

Thank you for visiting <3

This app uses the API from https://exchangeratesapi.io/.

To use this app, you need to:

1. Obtain an API key from https://exchangeratesapi.io/.
2. Add the following code to the local.properties file:
   2.1 The local.properties file should be placed in the same folder as the app folder (or create it if it doesn't exist).
   2.2 apiKey="<Enter your API key from step 1 here>"

I made this app in 3 day after along time not programm.
I had to complete this app in just 3 days, even though I hadn’t done any programming in a while. It’s a simple app, but there were quite a few challenges, especially since I was working alone without any guidance. Right now, I’m doing a job that’s not related to programming, which honestly makes me feel a bit frustrated.

I started by building the user interface first, which wasn’t too difficult because I’m already quite familiar with it. To save time on choosing colors, I decided to use the color palette from Binnace. At first, I thought about using a gradient with colors #2af598 & #009efd, similar to a banking app I know, but in the end, I preferred the Binnace colors more. =))

The challenges I faced while building this app weren’t anything too special—just little bugs I’ve encountered before back in college. The only thing that really gave me a headache was hiding the API key from GitHub. After about 3 hours of trying, I finally figured out the issue: my project structure was different from others, so I had to tweak a few lines of code, and that solved it!

I’ll admit, ChatGPT was a huge help, but using it effectively also drained me a bit.

The feature I like the most is the warning when users are using mobile data instead of Wi-Fi. Why? Well, I just don’t want users to accidentally spend money on mobile data.

The part I enjoyed the most about this project was testing for bugs. I really enjoy testing, and honestly, my attention to detail makes me pretty good at it.

Thanks you.
